# Levenshtein distance calculator

This is a small python program that calculates the Levenshtein distance between 2 words. I have already done a more or less similar project in [this repository](https://github.com/LordSeven777/levenshtein-distance-java) using **Java** so feel free to go there for more description.  
The code in this repository is way more documented that the one I made in Java so I hope you find it insightful.

## Getting started

To get started, you have to open the project first in any IDE of your choice and then run the `main.py` file.
